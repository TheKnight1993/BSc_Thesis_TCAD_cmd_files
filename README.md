# BSc_Thesis_TCAD_cmd_files
Repository containing the files that were used for the TCAD simulations that were performed for the BSc Thesis as seen in [the link to the TUDelft repository is as of yet still unavailable].

## sde_cmd_files
The files contained in this folder contain the scheme commands that are used for the creation of the 3D models of the different SPAD designs in the Sentaurus Structure Editor tool by Synopsis. 
There are comments included in the files to allow for users to determine what each block of scheme commands executes. These can be used as a baseline for further simulations, possibly containing more detail

## sdevice_cmd_files
The files contained in this folder contain the simulation declarations that are used in the simulation of the I-V and C-V curves in the Sentaurus Device simulator tool by Synopsis.
These files are relatively barebones and only provide very simple simulations.
